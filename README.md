Welcome to **Healsense AI** – an advanced healthcare assistant designed to analyze text, images, and audio to provide accurate medical insights and doctor recommendations.
We build agents for each of the work using Agno(Agentic AI)

📝 TEXT QUERY ANALYSIS --- 
Let's start with the Text Query Mode. Here, users can ask health-related questions, and our AI agent will provide precise medical insights. For example, if I type 'What are the symptoms of diabetes?', the AI instantly provides a detailed response. Not only that, it detects the disease from the response and automatically recommends top specialists for diabetes from our doctor database.
Each doctor profile includes their specialty, hospital name, and a direct profile link, making it easy for users to find the right medical expert

📷 IMAGE ANALYSIS --- 
Now, let's explore the Image Analysis Mode. Users can upload X-rays, MRI scans, or CT images, and our AI will analyze them to identify possible medical conditions. For example, when I upload a lung X-ray, the AI detects signs of pneumonia and provides an insightful medical analysis. Additionally, it automatically recommends Pulmonologists based on the detected condition.

🎤 AUDIO ANALYSIS ---
Our final feature is Audio Analysis Mode, where users can either record their voice or upload an audio file describing their symptoms. For instance, if someone describes chest pain and difficulty breathing, the AI processes the audio, identifies the potential issue as a cardiac condition, and recommends the best Cardiologists from our database.
Additionally, the system provides global expert recommendations, listing top specialists from India and worldwide for more advanced consultations.

CONCLUSION --- 
Healsense AI is an intelligent, all-in-one healthcare assistant that combines AI-driven medical analysis with real-time doctor recommendations. Whether through text, images, or voice, users can receive trusted insights and connect with the right medical professionals effortlessly.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Since this is a prototype, we can enhance it further by:
🔹 Expanding the doctor database for global specialists.
🔹 Integrating live consultation features with doctors.
🔹 Adding real-time speech processing for instant voice-based diagnosis.
🔹 Improving disease detection accuracy with advanced AI models.

Right now, Healsense AI is a functional prototype that demonstrates its capabilities, and with further improvements, it can become a full-fledged AI-powered healthcare assistant. 🚀🏥

Thank you for watching, and we hope Healsense AI brings value to the future of AI-powered healthcare!
